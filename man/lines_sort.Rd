\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of character strings including performances, with tow numbers
added by \code{add_row_numbers}}

\item{min_row}{the lowest row number}

\item{to_wide}{should the data frame x be converted to wide format?  Default
is \code{TRUE} as used in Hytek and Omega results.  Use \code{FALSE} in
