\usage{
hy3_parse(
  file,
  avoid = avoid_minimal,
  typo = typo_default,
  replacement = replacement_default
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{output from \code{read_results}}

\item{avoid}{a list of strings.  Rows in \code{x} containing these strings
will not be included. For example "Pool:", often used to label pool
records, could be passed to \code{avoid}.  The default is
\code{avoid_default}, which contains many strings similar to "Pool:", such
as "STATE:" and "Qual:".  Users can supply their own lists to \code{avoid}.}

\item{typo}{a list of strings that are typos in the original results.
\code{swim_parse} is particularly sensitive to accidental double spaces, so
"Central  High School", with two spaces between "Central" and "High" is a
problem, which can be fixed.  Pass "Central High School" to \code{typo}.
Unexpected commas as also an issue, for example "Texas, University of"
should be fixed using \code{typo} and \code{replacement}}

\item{replacement}{a list of fixes for the strings in \code{typo}.  Here one
could pass "Central High School" (one space between "Central" and "High")
and "Texas" to \code{replacement} fix the issues described in \code{typo}}
}
\value{
returns a data frame with columns \code{Name}, \code{Place},
  \code{Age}, \code{Team}, \code{Prelims_Time}, \code{Finals_Time}, &
  \code{Event}.  May also contain \code{Seed_Time}, \code{USA_ID}, and/or
  \code{Birthdate}.  Note all swims will have a \code{Finals_Time}, even if
  that time was actually swam in the prelims (i.e. a swimmer did not qualify
  for finals).  This is so that final results for an event can be generated
  from just one column.

\description{
Helper function used inside `swim_parse` for dealing with Hy-Tek .hy3 files.
Can have more columns than other `swim_parse` outputs, because .hy3 files can
contain more data
}
\seealso{
\code{parse_hy3} must be run on the output of
  \code{\link{read_results}}

\code{parse_hy3} runs inside of \code{\link{swim_parse}}
