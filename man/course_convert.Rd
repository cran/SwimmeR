Free"}, \code{"50 Back"}, \code{"200 Breast"} etc.}

\item{course}{The course in which the time was swum as \code{"LCM"},
\code{"SCM"} or \code{"SCY"}}

\item{course_to}{The course to convert the time to as \code{"LCM"},
\code{"SCM"} or \code{"SCY"}}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} will return a data frame containing columns \itemize{ \item
Time \item Course \item Course_To \item Event \item Time_Converted_sec
\item Time_Converted_mmss }.  If \code{FALSE} (the default) will return only a converted time.}
}
\value{
returns the \code{time} for a specified \code{event} and
  \code{course} converted to a time for the specified \code{course_to} in
